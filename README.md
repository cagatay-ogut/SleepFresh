# SleepFresh

SleepFresh is based on the idea of sleep cycles. One sleep cycle is approximately 90 minutes long. When the user sets auto alarm on, SleepFresh will track the phone screen and when it goes idle, it will set an alarm for the predefined duration. It also enables user to set a regular alarm.
